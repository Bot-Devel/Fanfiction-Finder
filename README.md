<h1 align="center">Fanfiction Finder</h1>

In this project, I created a discord bot written in Python which searches google for a fanfiction and parses the html into readable metadata and send the metadata as an embed message. <br>
# Bot Usage
Use `ao3 fic_name` to search a fanfiction.<br>
The query string is not case-sensitive so either uppercase, lowercase or combination of both can be used to search.<br>
The following is an example on how the bot works in realtime-<br>
