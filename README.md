# Bot Usage

To start using the bot on your discord server (You need to be an admin or owner to do this):

- Use `,allow` command in the channel you want to enable the bot
- Use `,disallow` command in the channel you want to disable the bot
- Use `,allow_all` command to enable the bot for all channels
- Use `,disallow_all` command to disable the bot for all channels

You can use `,help` command for the help menu which will show all the ways you can use to search for fanfiction using the bot.
<br>
Use `ao3 fic_name` or `ao3 fic_name series` and `ffn fic_name` to search a fanfiction. <br>
You can also use the url of the fanfiction for searching. <br>
The query string is not case-sensitive so either uppercase, lowercase or combination of both can be used to search.<br>
The following is an example on how the bot works in realtime-<br>
